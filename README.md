# 3D-Solar-Simulator

# Intro

A simple planet simulator created in three.js. Solar sim allows you to move around a 3D scaled scene of the planets in our solar system. Distances are scaled accurately to real planetary data (sadly we had to amplify the planet sizes for ease of view). You should be able to quickly set this up on most modern web browsers, check out the download instructions for that.

# Controls

**Camera orbit** - Arrow keys

**Toggle freelook** - f - on, 0 - off

**Zoom** - Scrolling or -= keys

**Change planet focus** - Numbers

**Time warping** - , and .

**Reset zoom** - r

# Download

Nice and simple to download this one, clone the repository and open up index.html in a html,css,js interpiter. You may need to use npm to install three.js but the library is included in the scripts so it should work fine.

# Pictures

Here are some pictures captured in the sim:
